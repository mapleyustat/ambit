Ambit
=====

The goal of ambit is to be a high-level C++ wrapper to existing tensor frameworks. The first iteration of ambit will provide a wrapper for local tensors and the Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF) found at https://github.com/solomonik/ctf.

Additionally, a goal of ambit is to provide a Python interface to the common high-level wrapper.
